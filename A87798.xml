         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And firſt, <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> leafe the 30. ſaith, As a naturall body cannot be without a head, ſo a Realme cannot be governed without a head, which is the King: And there he further ſaith, That whenſoever of many, one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted amongſt them, one ſhall be Governour, and the reſt ſhall be governed. <hi>Britton,</hi> leafe the 1. ſaith, The King is ordained of God, that the Peace be kept; the which cannot be well without Law.

                  <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the 1. Chap. 1. Common Right ſhould be made to all, as well to Poore as to Rich, without regard of any: See <hi>Stamford, fol.</hi> 56. of Juſtice.</p>

               <p>18 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. The Statute of the Oath of the Judges, is, If any Letters to the Juſtices come contrary to the Law, that you ſhall doe nothing for ſuch Letters, but certifie the King of it, and reſolve before to execute the Law, notwithſtanding thoſe Letters.</p>
               <p>And to conclude of theſe matters, You ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that God created Man, onely to ſerve him, and created all other creatures in the World, for the ſervice and uſe of Man; as the Prophet ſaith, Thou haſt ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted all things under his feet, all Sheep and Oxen, and likewiſe the Beaſts of the Feild, Birds of the Aire, and Fiſhes of the Sea, which walke through the paths of the Sea; ſo that all was made for the uſe of Man, and yet without Law a man cannot injoy that; and God being mindfull of Man, to ſerve him as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>What is Man that thou art mindfull of him, or the Son of Man, that thou haſt regard unto him:</hi> And for that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Kings to governe, and to keep men in obedience, to ſerve and obey God, the King, and his Lawes, for to diſobey is deteſtable: And <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap. 13. ſaith, Every ſoule is ſubject to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God, which powers verily are ordained by God; ſo that whoſoever reſiſteth that power doth reſiſt the Ordinance of God: And <hi>Peter,</hi> Chap. 2. ſaith, Be ſubject to every humane Creature, for the Lord, and to the King as Saperiour. And then for that, that the King is ordained of God, to make his people to ſerve
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:122180:6"/>God, and to keep his people in obedience: If you diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the King, you breake that which is commanded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the Scriptures, and ſo you diſobey God: And you ſee that if God had not been mindfull of us, and had not created and ordained the King to governe us (being of fraile nature) and that by Lawes to bridle our fraile nature, none could enjoy his Lands, Goods, nor his life in ſafety: And for that, that the Law is ſo neceſſary. Now let us ſee when, and how, theſe Courts Leets, and Court Barons began.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fineux,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe Courts Leets or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</note> 12. H. 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 18. ſaith, That at the beginning all the adminiſtration of Juſtice was in the Crowne, and where the King was, there was the Law adminiſtred: Then afterward, for the multiplicity of the people, was the Court Leet for puniſhment of offences, and annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to the Common-wealth within the Precinct of that, and the Articles and paines are ordained to that end, and it is called, <hi>The view of franke pledge,</hi> for that the King there may be certified by the view of the Steward, how many people are within every Leet; and alſo to have account and view by the Steward, of their good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and manners in every Leet: And alſo the Leet was ordained to have every perſon, of the age of twelve years, which had remained there by a yeare and a day, to be ſworne to be faithfull and loyall to the King; and alſo for that, that the people there might be kept in peace and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, theſe Courts Leets were ordained.</p>
               <p>And Court-Barons were ordained to determine Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <note place="margin">Court-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</note> Treſpaſſes, Debts, and other actions, as afterwards it appeareth, where the debt or the dammages are under forty ſhillings: And alſo for that, that the Lords of the Mannors and Court-Barons, have given their Tenants their Lands and Tenements, before the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> the third, to hold of them, for that alſo Homagers of Court ought to inquire in this Court, that their Lords ſhall not looſe their Services, Cuſtomes, nor duties. And alſo it was ordained to make their Suites there, and ſo to ſhew them obedient to their Lords, and that nothing be made within the Mannor, to be an annoyance or hurtfull to the Inheritances of the Lords of the Mannors, which ſhould not there be inquired of, and preſented for the Lords of the Mannors, as afterward. by the Articles more plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:122180:6"/>And ſo now you ſee here breifly, that the Realm cannot be governed without a King; and that the King for that cauſe is appointed of God, and that the King go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne by the Law, <note place="margin">Roy Ley.</note> and cannot governe his people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law; and alſo you have heard, how ancient and how neceſſary theſe two Courts are for governance of the People.</p>
               <p>And now for that theſe Courts are held within Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and that a Court-Baron is incident to a Mannor; It is fit to know how Mannors did begin, and within what Mannors Court-Barons are held, and in what not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parkins, fol.</hi> 127. ſaith, That the beginning of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors was when the King gave a thouſand Acres of Land, or a greater or leſſer parcel to one and his heires, to hold of him and his heirs: and before the St. of <hi>Quia emptores terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> (becauſe buyers of Land) one ſeiſed of Lands did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffe one of ten Acres, another of twelve Acres, and the third of twenty Acres, every one of them to make ſervice unto him; and ſo by continuance of time out of minde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he had a Mannor.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> 8. <hi>b.</hi> Where a man giveth all his Land in Taile, there is a Signiorie Ingroſſe, and he ſhall have no Court; but if he were ſeiſed of a Mannor, and give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Demeſnes in taile, it is otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>22. H. 6. Title 2. Services is parcell of a Mannor, but not the Land of the Mannor, unleſſe it be Copihold, for if a man hath a Mannor in the County of <hi>Weſtmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and one holdeth Land of that Mannor, which Land is in the County of DARBY, hee ſhall demand

               <p>18. of the Booke of Aſſiſes, 3. If a man ſeiſed of a Mannor, doe alien foure Acres in fee, this is ſeparated, and no part of the Mannor; but if the Husband ſeiſed of a Mannor in right of his Wife: alien foure Acres for life, and afterwards grant the Reverſion of that in fee to P. and afterwards P. purchaſe the whole Mannor, to which the Husband and Wife levie a Fine, <note place="margin">Sur con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſance de Droit.</note> upon acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Right, as that which he had of their gift. The Fine extendeth to the foure Acres which were ſevered, for they were parcell in reverſion, as of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</p>
               <p>And in the 36. H. 8.4. Two Coparceners make parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Mannor, ſo that each of theſe have a parcell in Demeſnes, and a parcell in Services: Now each of theſe hath a Mannor, and each of theſe have two Suitors, but otherwiſe it is if one have but one Suitor, he cannot hold a Court-Baron: But 12. H. 4.25. Partition is made of a Mannor, that one Coparcener ſhall have the Demeſnes and the other the Services, the Suit to the Court is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and during that there ſhall be no Court-Baron held: And 8. H. 3.4. and 34. H. 6.53. It is held that a Court-Baron is belonging to a Mannor of common right, ſo that within every Mannor ſhall be a Court-Baron, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there be no Suitors there, or that by partition the Suit is ſuſpended, as it is before ſaid: But note that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe are called Mannors, within which are not any that hold of theſe Mannors, but only Copiholders at the will of the Lord, according to the Cuſtome of the Mannor, and there are no Freeholders which hold by Charter; and yet theſe Lordſhips are called Mannors, and in theſe are Court-Barons, 19. H. 8.17. Court-Baron is belonging to a Mannor.</p>
               <p>And now though the honourable Judges of both Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the Honourable Lord cheife Baron, and the other Judges there of Record, at this day are altogether given to adminiſter Juſtice to all, without reſpect of any Perſons, <note place="margin">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:122180:7"/>to the adminiſtration of Juſtice, may be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient example to all Stewards, to adminiſter Juſtice, and not to have regard to Letters: Yet in ſome Court-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, I have ſeen ſuch ſubverting of Juſtice by Stewards, ſome by Ignorance and wilfulneſſe, and ſome Stewards to pleaſe their Lords, and for feare of looſing their Fee, being but Stewards at the will of their Lords, and ſome for Letters, and other cauſes, that Juſtice many times hath not place there, to the perillous example and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Eſtate; and for that, that henceforth hereafter Juſtice in theſe Courts may be the better adminiſtred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I ſhall treat of the Courts aforeſaid, I think it is convenient to write to the Stewards, theſe ſentences inſuing, to be a Glaſſe to Stewards to reade their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remembrance to adminiſter Juſtice, and for that it thus followeth.</p>
               <p>Who worketh Juſtice, he ſhall be advanced. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed are they which hunger and thirſt for Juſtice, for they ſhall be ſatisfied, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Juſtice advanceth a Nation, and it maketh a miſerable people to be pacified, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>He that juſtifieth a wicked man, and condemneth the juſt man, he is moſt abominable with God, <hi>Pro.</hi> 17.15. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs your Juſtice abound more then that of the Scribes and Phariſees, you cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. The ſoules of the Juſt are in the hands of God, <hi>Wiſedome.</hi> In the ſtreight path of Juſtice, but the contrary way leadeth to death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Love God, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe, then if you doe not Juſtice, how doe you love him, who is Juſtice and truth, and how doe you love your neighbour as your ſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. Juſtice ſurely is immortall and everlaſting, Injuſtice is the wages of death; love Juſtice you that Judge the Earth, <hi>Wiſedome</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Riches doe not prevaile in the day of revenge, but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhall free from death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. God ſhall give to the Juſt the reward of their labours, <hi>Wiſedome</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>And if any love Juſtice, his labours have great vertues, ſobriety and vertue, then which there is nothing more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in this life to men, <hi>Wiſedome</hi> 1.</p>

               <p>Note that none may make Proclamation, but by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the King, or Maiors, and ſuch like, where they have uſed it by Cuſtome, 22. H. 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>Then forthwith after the three Proclamations made, the Steward ſhall make the Bailiffe to ſay, All manner of Perſons which are reſident, or Deciners, and doe owe Suit royall to this Leet, come in and make your Suit, and anſwer to your names, every one upon paine and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill which ſhall enſue.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And forthwith after the three Proclamations made, the Steward ſhall cauſe the Bailiffe to ſay,</p>

               <p>Then after this the Jury ſhall be impannelled, and firſt, one ſhall be ſworne, and after three or foure together, and the Oath ſhall be as followeth.</p>

               <p>Note in the 27. <note place="margin">In Feloni tantum.</note> of the Book of Aſſiſes, p. 65. a Juror was arraigned in the Kings Bench as a Felon, for that he was one of the Indictors of certaine perſons of felony,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:122180:9"/>and diſcovered the counſell of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Companions, and in Leet it is counſell of the King: Yet (Seck) if he were attaint, what Judgement ſhall be given.</p>
               <p>And when the Foreman of the Jury for Court Leet, or Court Baron is ſworne, three or foure ſhall come to the Booke together, and ſhall be ſworne together, as afore is ſaid.</p>
               <p>To which the Steward ſhall ſay, The ſame Oath which J.

               <p>For 6.

If any ſtranger be there, if there be not ſufficient reſidents there to be impannelled, the Steward may impannell a ſtranger there, for that it is to enquire for the King, and for redreſſing matters which are annoyances to the Common-wealth; and if more be ſworne then twelve (as they may be for the King) yet if twelve of them agree, and the reſidue not, it is a good Verdict, and it uſed very often to be fifteene, ſixteene, or ſeventeene of the Jury in the Leet; but a Jury to try an Iſſue betweene parties by twelve one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it appeareth by 21. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 31. and 29. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 43.

               <p>The cauſe that the Jury ſhall be ſworne, is, That the end of all controverſie to confirmation is an Oath, and this is the cauſe that the Juries are ſworne, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe credited: And ſee <hi>Forteſcue, fol.</hi> 54.

               <p>Tenant pleads a feoffment made by <hi>J. S.</hi> to him and gives colour, Plaintif ſaith, that <hi>J. D.</hi> levied a fine upon releaſe to him, and it is not good, but to ſay that he was

               <p>Asſiſe of Rent, it is no title to ſhew that <hi>J. S.</hi> granted to him the Rent by Deed or by Fine, but he ought to ſhew how the Rent began, that is to ſay, If it be a Rent charge, or a Rent ſervice, or a Rent Seck, 31 Aſſ. 16.</p>
               <p>Asſiſe, the tenant pleads in Barr feoffment of the Father of the Plaintif with warranty, and the Plaintif ſaith, that his Anceſtor died ſeifed, and this diſcended to him, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Scroope</hi> without ſhewing how he came to that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, 10 book Aſſ. 23.</p>
               <p>VVhere the tenant praies the Asſiſe upon the title, and upon that the Asſiſe is awarded, the Asſiſe cannot finde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther title for the Plaintiff, but he may finde matter, which may ſtand with the ſame title to inforce it, but if the title be traverſed, he cannot finde another title, but only the point put in the Asſiſe, 28 book of Aſſiſes 17.</p>
               <p>An Act of Parliament, Fine or Recovery are of ſuch a force, that if one be bound by them, the Plaintif cannot

                  <p>IF Tenant by Coppy ſurrender generally into the hands of the Lord, and it do not appeare who ſhall have the Land, nor to what uſe the ſurrender is, then the Lord ſhall be ſeiſed to his own uſe.</p>
                  <p>If Tenants by Coppy let for yeares by licenſe of the Lord, and after releaſe to the Leſſee by theſe words in the Court (remiſe and releaſe) it is void, for that it ought to be ſurrendred into the hands of the Lord, and then the Lord ought to grant the Reverſion to the Leſſee; for by <hi>Littleton fol.</hi> 15. It cannot paſſe without ſurrender, and yet a Releaſe is uſed of Coppy-hold in the Court in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Steward.</p>
                  <p>If the Lord grant parcell of his Demeſne Lands, to hold by Coppy, to one and his Heires, this Coppy is not good, but at the will of the Leſſor, for one cannot make Coppy-hold at this day, but that ſhall be by preſcription, which hath been demiſed and demiſable by Coppy, time out of minde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if a Coppy-hold eſcheate to the Lord, or he enter in that by forfeiture, and at this day grant that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>J.S.</hi> by Coppy, this is good Coppy, and yet, in 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 7. If Lands in ancient Demeſne are eſcheated, and the King ſeiſeth them, and grants them over to <hi>J. S.</hi> they are frank fee and not ancient Demeſne.</p>
                  <p>6 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 2. But if a Coppy-hold ſhall be eſcheated to the Lord, and twenty yeares after that, he grants them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by Copy againe, they are Copy-hold as they were before, for that, that this Land hath been demiſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſable, time out of minde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If two be Joyntenants by Copy, and one of them makes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:122180:83"/>waſte in all the Land, that ſhall not be forfeiture, but for his part, and alſo if a ſtranger cuts Trees and makes waſte without aſſent of the Coppy-holder, it is no forfeiture.</p>
                  <p>If the Lord of a Mannor, to which there are Coppy-holders grant by Copy the tenements of one tenant Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-holder without juſt cauſe, to another Tenant in Fee or for life, and the Grantee enter by vertue of that grant, this Tenant which hath right, and which was admitted before, may have a plaint in nature of an Aſſiſe of novel diſſeiſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Grantee.</p>
                  <p>If the Husband ſurrender into the hands of the Lord, to the uſe of his Wife, and doth not ſay <hi>A.</hi> his Wife, it is a good ſurrender, for ſhe is certainly known by that name; the ſame Law is, if one ſurrender into the hands of the Lord to the uſe of <hi>J.</hi> his Son, and hath two Sons named <hi>J.</hi> it is to the uſe of that <hi>J.</hi> which it is ment to.</p>
                  <p>If Tenant by Copy ſurrender his Lands by cuſtome of the Mannour, to two good men out of the Court, to the uſe of a ſtranger, and that made for Money paid, he which ſurrendred cannot countermand his ſurrender before the two good men have preſented it at the next Court, for it is much like acknowledging of a Fine before a Juſtice of Record, but where the ſurrender is to two, to the uſe of his Wife or Son, and not to a ſtranger for Money paid, by one lying in extreamity in perill of death, and after he revives, he may well countermand his Surrender, before it be preſented in Court, or after, if it be not by that admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted afterwards, and that is often uſed, and ſtands with reaſon, and ſo is the Law as it ſeems to me.</p>
                  <p>If Tenant by Copy of Court-roll be attaint of Felony or Treaſon, the Lord of the Mannour may enter, for Tenant by Copy is but Tenant at will, according to the Common Law, though he hath Inheritance by the cuſtome.</p>
                  <p>If a Copy-holder ſurrender into the hands of the Lord, to the uſe of another and his Heires, if the Lord will not admit him Tenant, then the Land ſhall remaine in him which made the ſurrender, and yet he to whoſe uſe it was made, may ſue by a petition, or by a <hi>Subpena</hi> to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>If one which hath no right, and was not admitted, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render to the uſe of another, and he to whoſe uſe the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:122180:84"/>is made, enters into the Land and is admitted, yet he which hath right may re-enter and out him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Grant of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeems if a Coppy-hold deſcends to <hi>J.S.</hi> and he, before that he is admitted Tenant, ſurrender that to the uſe of <hi>J. D.</hi> and the Lord by his Steward in Court grant Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin and admits him Tenant, it is ſaid to be a good ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and <hi>J.

S. J. S.</hi> cannot ſurrender before he be admitted.</p>
                  <p>The Lord of the Mannour (where the cuſtome is that the Tenants hold by Copy) is Chancellour within the ſame Court, <note place="margin">Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</note> and may redreſſe matters there in conſcience where a Bill is exhibited to him, <note place="margin">Suitors.</note> ſo that the Coppy-holders are no Judges in the Court.</p>
                  <p>If an under Steward hold a Court-Baron without autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Lord or high Steward, <note place="margin">Steward.</note> and the Lord agree and do not contradict the Steward, and there be ſurrenders made, and admittances of Copy-holders in the Court, this is good, but if he take a ſurrender and admit one out of the Court without authority of the Lord or high Steward, it is not good, notwithſtanding a lawfull Steward, as it ſeems may take a ſurrender out of the Court, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance made out of the Court is good, if it be entred in the Court-Roll, that he is admitted and hath paid his Fine, and hath done fealty.</p>
                  <p>And if one holds but one Court by appointment of the Lord, where another hath a Patent to be Steward, and is abſent, ſurrender taken and entred in this Court is good, and alſo is admittance, 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 26.</p>
                  <p>Note that the high Stewards are for moſt part men of honor, <note place="margin">Steward.</note> and great men by patent, and their under Stewards are men learned and are appointed by them, and without Patent, and the uſe is, that they which are under Stewards to ſuch men, take Surrenders out of the Court, and they are well taken by ſuch under Stewards, and the parties are admitted in the Courts held by them, that is in open Court, and alſo no doubt, when ſuch under Stewards take ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                  <p>Where the Steward of the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> of his Mannor of <hi>Horneſey,</hi> hath a Patent of his Office with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Dean and Chapter by the name of <hi>Aldred Fitziames,</hi> where his name was <hi>Etheldred,</hi> ſurrenders taken by him out of the Court, and at the next Court are entred, it is found by the Homage that ſuch ſurrender was made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and at the ſame Court the Tenant is admitted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and though that his Patent in time of the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for after in Aſſiſe againſt him be defeated by miſ-naming or by other cauſe, yet the Surrenders taken by <hi>Aldred Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>james</hi> (during all the time of twenty yeares before his Patent was defeated) are good and perfect, for that, that the ſurrender was, it is found by the Homage, and alſo for that he was the known Steward, and alſo for that he is Judge, 33 H. 8. <hi>Br. Charge</hi> 58. <hi>Confirm.</hi> 30.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Law ſeems in the ſame caſe, if the entry were it is witneſſed by the Steward or at this Court it is inrolled, ſo, that is to ſay, that <hi>J.S.</hi> came before the Steward (the Court being abſent) and ſurrendred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in full Court the admittance is accordingly, this is a good ſurrender,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:122180:85"/>though it be not entred, it is found by the Homage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the entry of admittance is.</p>
                  <p>The Lord by <hi>A. Fitziames</hi> Steward gave him Seiſin thereof, and it is that the Lord by his Steward admitted him, and for that it is good, inſomuch that to that is the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and grant of him which ſurrendred, and alſo of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Law if the high Steward to <hi>J.S.</hi> which hath no Patent in writting of his Office, takes a Surrender out of the Court, and at the next Court enters that, at the next Court it is inrolled, ſo that <hi>J. S.</hi> came before the Steward (the Court being abſent) and ſurrendred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he to whoſe uſe the ſurrender was made be admitted in full Court, this is a good ſurrender.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Law is like, if <hi>J. D.</hi> be Steward to a corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without a Patent of his Office, and takes ſurrender as above, out of the Court and at the next Court enters it, at this Court inrolled, ſo that <hi>J.D.</hi> ſuch a day came before <hi>J. D.</hi> Steward and ſurrendred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he to whoſe uſe the ſurrender is made is admitted in full Court, this is a good ſurrender, for that, that the Steward doth in a Court of copy-hold, he doth it as Judge and is allowed Judge by the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Law is, if the Steward which is out-Lawed in a perſonall action or excommunicated, take a ſurrender out of the Court, and at the next Court enter it, it is witneſſed by the Steward, and ſuch a ſurrender is made, and admits him to whoſe uſe the ſurrender was made in full Court, though it was not found by the Homage, yet this ſurrender is good.</p>
                  <p>If a Judge or a Juſtice be out of his Wits, yet the Fines, Judgments, and other records which were before him ſhall be good, but contrary the gift of an Office, or ſuch like by him, for that is a matter indeed, and the others are matters of Record, for a matter in deed may be avoyded (by being out of his Wits) contrary of matter of Record, 1 <hi>Ma. Tit.</hi> whileſt he was not in his Wits 7.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Law is, if the under Steward takes a ſurrender out of the Court, and at the next Court makes his entry of it, at this Court it is witneſſed that <hi>J. D.</hi> ſurrendred, and in full Court he to whoſe uſe the ſurrender is made, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, this is a good ſurrender, though it be not alſo (it
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:122180:85"/>is found by the Homage) for when he holds Court, he is a Judge between the Lord and the copy-holders, and yet, 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>Br.</hi> Court-Baron 22. and copy-hold the 26. is, if the under Steward holds a Court-Baron, and in full Court grants copy-hold without the authority of the Lord or high ſteward, this is good, contrary Law where it is done out of the Court, for it ſeems if the under Steward grants copy-holds, it is intended that if he admits any out of the Court without authority, it is not good, for it is, the Lord granted by his Steward, and not that the Steward granted, for he cannot grant. And alſo the high Steward may admit out of the Court, by ſpeciall uſage and cuſtome within the Mannor uſed, for one which holds by copy of Court roll, ought to have his Eſtate entred in the Court held, and his admittance to be entred in the Court, and for that if the under Steward or the high Steward which hath no Patent, as above, take ſurrender out of the Court, and preſent that in Court, and the Tenant be in the Court admitted, it is good, for it is the Lord by his Steward hath admitted, and the admittance makes him a copy-holder and the Entry of that in Court makes him Tenant by copy of Court roll, for copy-holder is he which holdeth by copy of Court roll, ſo where one admitted in Court and the Lord allowes a Steward, is good.</p>
                  <p>If a copy-holder of an Eſtate in fee, according to the cuſtome of the Mannour, by licenſe of his Lord let for twenty yeares rendring forty ſhillings yearly, he may have an action of Debt in the common place for this Rent, or as it ſeems he may diſtraine and avow, and yet the avowrie is in the nature of an action reall, and it ſeems no doubt if the Rent be reſerved by Deed Indent, but that he may diſtraine and avow, and yet if (he to whoſe uſe) before the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. lets by Indenture for yeares, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Rent, he to whoſe uſe ſhall have Debt for that Rent, but he cannot avow, and if the Leſſee in this caſe make waſte, he to whoſe uſe, ſhall not have an action of waſt, 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>f.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Law is, where a copy-holder by the cuſtome of the Mannour is not puniſhable for waſte, by licenſe of the Lord makes a Leaſe for thirty yeares, and the Leſſee makes waſte, the copy-holder ſhall not have a Writ of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:122180:86"/>waſte but ſhall ſue in the Lords Court, to puniſh this waſte by plaint, in nature of an action upon the caſe.</p>
                  <p>If a coppy-holder of an Eſtate taile by licenſe of his Lord let for twenty yeares, rendring the ancient Rent, and dies, the Iſſue in taile may enter and defeat the Leſſee, but if the Tenant in taile of coppy-hold let for forty years by the Lords licenſe, and after the Leaſe makes a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his coppy-hold, and the Lord ſeiſes it, and grants that over again by copy to the Tenant in taile and his Heires, or to <hi>J. S.</hi> and his Heires, it ſeems there the Iſſue of the Leſſor, nor <hi>J. S.</hi> nor the Lord cannot enter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat this leaſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Law is, if a coppy-holder of an Eſtate taile lets for forty yeares by the Lords licenſe and dies, and his Iſſue ſurrenders to <hi>J. S.</hi> and his Heires, this Iſſue nor <hi>J. S.</hi> cannot enter and defeat this Leaſe.</p>
                  <p>To this Court came <hi>T.

               <p>And if you will admit that an Eſtate Tail by uſage of time out of minde, may be of Copy-hold within a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, where it hath been uſed by preſcription, and Plaints of <hi>(Formedon)</hi> have there been brought, why will ye doubt, but that it may be well cut off by common recovery, in Plaint, in nature of a Writ of Entry in the <hi>(Poſt)</hi> or at leaſt in nature of a Writ of Right, and <hi>Miſe</hi> ioyned upon meer Right, and after Default made by the Tenant, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment final given, though that theſe Recoveries have not been uſed there by preſcription, for they are at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and Plaints in nature of theſe Writs are to be ſued there of copy-hold.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that a Fine levied in ancient Demeſne is of no worth, for it is no Court of Record; but it is ſaid, that common Recoveries may be ſued there, to cut off the Intail, and good, for that, that the land ſhall be pleaded there by a Writ of Right cloſe, and not otherwiſe, and copy-holder ſhall be impleaded in Court Baron of the Mannour by Plaint, and not elſewhere. And for that the Recoveries aforeſaid, to cut off the Intail of a copy-holder may be there, though they were not there uſed before, if there be Eſtates Tail there, and if uſage makes the Eſtate Tail, and alſo uſage makes the copy-holder to have an Eſtate of Inheritance by cuſtome, and is good, 50. <hi>Book of Aſſiſes</hi> 9.47 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.38.</p>
               <p>And though <hi>Littleton, fol.</hi> 16. If Lord out his copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, he hath no other remedy but to ſue to his Lord by Petition, for he ſaith, the Lord cannot break the cuſtome
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:122180:91"/>which is reaſonable; but if ſuch Lord will break the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, it is no Reaſon to ſuffer ſuch a Lord to be his own Judge, and to compell a copy-holder to ſue to him by Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But for that that divers Lords are of an ill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that before were as I have heard, for that divers grave Judges now hold, that a tenant copy-holder may have Treſpaſs againſt his Lord, according to the opinion of <hi>Brian</hi> and <hi>Danby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this at this day ſeems reaſon, for though at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning copy-holders had but Eſtate at the will of the Lord, yet by the continuance of this Eſtate of time out of minde, they have ſuch Inheritance by the cuſtome of the Mannour that the Lord (doing his Services) cannot out them, and the preſcription goes to the Land, and not to the Lord, nor to the occupation, for that is copy-hold land which hath been let, and demiſable time out of minde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Tenant by copy deny to do his Services, the Lord may enter for forfeiture, if it be preſented by the Homage; but if the Tenant by chance makes a Default at the Lords Court, and doth not deny his Service, it ſhall be amerced, and is no Forfeiture; the ſame Law if his Rent be behinde, and he doth not deny to pay it, that is no Forfeiture, but the Lord may diſtrain, but by <hi>Littleton, fol.</hi> 51. If the Tenant upon demand be not ready to pay Rent Seck, or if the Tenant nor none for him, be dwelling upon the Land to pay the Rent Seck, when it is demanded, this denying is Diſſeiſin; yet in the caſe aforeſaid, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that where a copy-holder makes Default, and doth not deny his Services, or is not upon the Land ready to pay upon demand, this is no deniall which ſhall make a Forfeiture, for Forfeitures are not favoured in Law, but to be taken ſtrictly according to the words, and that is to be intended upon denying in deed by the Tenant, 42 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>And it ſeems that the Lord cannot enter for forfeiture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that that be found by Homage, but if a Copy-holder alien by Charter, or commits Felony, or Treaſon, and be attaint, theſe are Forfeitures without Preſentment, and the Lords may enter, for theſe are notorious and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to be againſt the Cuſtome, but otherwiſe it ſeems where a Copy-holder makes waſte.</p>

               <p>If copy-holder lets by Indenture, which is forfeiture, and after ſurrenders to the uſe of <hi>J.

               <p>It is ſaid, that a copy-holder cannot alien by Deed, for if he do ſo, the Lord may enter for forfeiture, and ſo it is the like if he alien without Deed, in ſuch manner that the Land may paſſe, as if he lets for life without Deed, and makes livery, the Lord may enter, but if he do not make Livery otherwiſe it is; the ſame Law it is, if a copy-holder bargain and ſell his Land by Indenture, and do not inroll it, nothing paſſeth by this bargain, and for that it is no forfeiture, <hi>Lit. f.</hi> 14.</p>

               <p>NOte, that it is commonly ſaid, and the ground of paying Fines is, that a Fine is due to the Lord upon every alteration, and change of Tenant, that is to ſay, upon every admittance of every new Tenant, to the Lord by copy, as upon every alienation by ſurrender, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance upon that, and upon every diſcent and admittance upon that, alſo if a Copy-holder ſurrender into the hands of the Lord to the uſe of diverſe and their Heires, as to 2.3. or 4. and their Heires, upon the admittance of them the Lord ſhall have but one Fine, for it is but one ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and one admittance of a Tenant, and upon the death of the Survivor, and the admittance of his Heire, then an other Fine, ſo that the Fine is to be adjudged, due alwaies upon admittance of Tenant and not without admittance.</p>
               <p>And for that if two be admitted and one dies, the other ſhall have his part by Survivor without new admittance, and ſhall not pay a Fine.</p>
               <p>Alſo where a Surrender is made to the uſe of a Husband and his Wife, and to the Heires of the Husband, upon their admittance the Lord ſhall have but one Fine, for it is one ſurrender, and both are but one new Tenant, and after the death of the Husband and the Wife, upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance of the Heire of the Husband, the Lord ſhall have another Fine.</p>
               <p>Alſo where a ſurrender is made to one for life and after his death, the remainder to another, and the Heires of his
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:122180:123"/>Body begotten, and for default of ſuch Iſſue, remainder to a third and his Heires; in this caſe admittance of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life, veſts the remainder in the others, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers learned Stewards take but one Fine only of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a Tenant for tearme of life, and nothing of thoſe two in remainder, when the Remainder falls, but I have ſeen that every one in the remainder, when they come to the Land ſhall make Fine, though it be not the whole fine but a halfe, and every one is admitted when a remainder falls, but it need not, for by the admittance of the Tenant for life, the remainder is ſo veſted that he in remainder need no other admittance, and they are but one Eſtate and one ſurrender, the ſame Law is where there is a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render to one for life, the remainder to another and his Heires, there ſhall be but one Fine.

               <p>Alſo where a Copy-holder is admitted upon ſurrender he ſhall pay a Fine, but if it be ſo that he have common recovery in plaint, in nature of a VVrit of entry in the <hi>(Poſt)</hi> upon his better aſſurance, and for to defeat an eſtate taile, thoſe which recover have Seiſin by command (by <hi>Habere facias Seiſinam</hi>) and alſo they are in, in the <hi>(Poſt)</hi> and by the recovery, and for that no Fine ſhal be there payd to the Lord but one, for the recovery was alſo but for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſurance, and the ſurrender and all make but one Tenant by Copy, and ſo there is due but one Fine.</p>

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:122180:124"/>he ſhall pay for a Fine three ſhillings there, if the Tenant makes of one Houſe two Houſes or build a new Houſe, he ſhall not pay a Fine for theſe new Houſes, nor for two Houſes, which before was but one, for the preſcription doth not hold place, but for the old Houſes.</p>
               <p>Alſo where the cuſtome is, that for a Fine for a licenſe to let for yeares, the Tenant ſhall pay for every Houſe, which the Tenant lets for every yeare that he hath licenſe, foure pence, there if he make of one Houſe diverſe Cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as of Barnes and Stables, diverſe Cottages there for licenſe to let his Houſe, he ſhall pay but foure pence for every yeare that he hath licenſe to let the whole, and not for divers Houſes, for otherwiſe the preſcription doth not hold place.</p>
